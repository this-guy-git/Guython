---GUYTHON V1.0.0B2536---
-------------------------

'ver' to show current Guython version.

'exit' to exit the console.

'var' to show all currently declared variables.

'debug' to enter debug mode.

spaces are optional between any function: print"abc" and print "abc" return the same.

opperand is a comparison, such as "<", ">", "and", "or", or, "not".

indentation is a '.', indentation MUST be used afer a while or if, anything not in the indentation is not part of the while or if.

variables are a string that can be set to a value such as a string or a number, variables can be called by any function other than import.

math operations are possible, such as "5+5" will return "10".

comments are declared with a '-', for example "-this is a comment and will be ignored".

-------------------------
in order of importance (what gets checked first):

def    : syntax: (def{functionName}_), function: declares a function which can then be called upon with '{functionName}_'. Functions MUST have an '_' at then end of name or they will not be recognized

while  : syntax: (while{variableName}|{number},{opperand},{variableName}|{number}), function: repeats following functions while the operation is true

if     : syntax: (if{variableName}|{number},{opperand},{variableName}|{number}), function: does any function if the if is true

goto   : syntax: (goto{lineNumber}), function: goes to the line declared

import : syntax: (import{fileName}.gy|.guy) | (import {fileName}.gy|.guy), function: imports a .gy|.guy file's variables, ex: import {fileName}.gy, print {fileName}.{variableName}

input  : syntax: ({variableName}=input) | ({printinput}), function: saves the input or prints the input

print  : syntax: (print"str"|{variableName}|print"str"{variableName}), function: prints the following, additions: ',' using the ',' modifier in between two data adds a space between the two, print "str","wow" will print "str wow" and print "str""wow" will print "strwow"

any easter egg

guython: syntax: (guython{fileName}.gy|.guy), function: runs the guython file using the interpreter
