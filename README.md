### **GUYTHON**

Guython is a ***VERY*** simple programming language created with Python.

**PLEASE** read 'grammar.txt' as it contains all syntax on the current version of Guython.

If you have any ***suggestions*** then add them to the issues with the **suggestion** tag!

**IF YOU USE THE INSTALLER VERSION AND ARE IMPORTING FILES MAKE SURE THEM 'GUYTHON.EXE' IS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS *BOTH* FILES!***

### **Installation**
Installing Guython is very easy!
- Install the 'guython{ver}.zip' file.
- Unzip the file.
- Run the 'guython.py' file.

### **Running external files**
Run an external file by placing your '.guy' or '.gy' file in the same directory as the 'guython.py' file, and then use the command 'guython {fileName}.gy/.guy' in the intepreter.
OR run 'python guython.py {fileName}.gy/.guy' in the cmd prompt or terminal while in the same directory as the 'guython.py' file.

### **GPD**
The Guython Package Database or GPD is a package mangaer for Guython similar to Python's pip. Add your own Guython packages [here](https://github.com/this-guy-git/guython-packages)
